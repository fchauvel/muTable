A first release of &mu;Table will soon be available! We are currently polishing it. They main 
features that will be available are:

* Internal DSL for querying rows, including all commonly used operators (e.g., equality, superiority,
 regular expression matching)
* Tables combinations (i.e., rows-bind and column-bind)
* CSV serialization
